- This page is for a topic or theme of ongoing interest
- Good place to store any info that is "generally" relevant, not "personally"
	- Personal relevant information should definitely go into an [[aor]] since it will likely be updated over time
	- Generally relevant information is for things that aren't personal to me, and can be used by anyone
		- SQL programming notes
		- Databricks
		- Etc
- The idea is that resources can be used by anyone freely
- The resources will follow a [[zettelkasten]] workflow
	- [[resource/inbox]]
		- Any raw information, notes, etc
	- [[resource/processing]]
		- Cleanup up, formatted, and rewritten inbox notes and ideas
	- [[resource/atomic]]
		- Not quite sure about using this page/hierarchy
		- Options
			- resource/atomic/{topic}/{sub_topic}/{name}
			- resource/{topic}/{sub_topic}/{name}
			- resource/{name}
