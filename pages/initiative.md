	- The whole house renovation is an [[initiative]]
	- Each room (kitchen, master bedroom, master bathroom, living room) would be an [[epic]]
	  id:: 6377fda4-d92f-482b-9725-a1d48c403083
	- Each part of each room (cabinets, sink, countertop, walls, floorplan) would be a [[story]]
	- Each part of each part of each room (remove old countertop, install new countertop, remove cabinets, new cabinets, paint cabinets) are each a [[task]]
- Each [[epic]] doesn't have to belong to an initiative
	- An initiative for me would be like graduating college
	- Each class would be an epic
	- Each assignment would be a story
	- Each part of each assignment would be a task
