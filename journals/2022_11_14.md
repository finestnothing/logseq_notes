	- Looking at sso documentation for [[bal/sam]]
		- Things to change:
			- SSO Documentation
				- Helpful articles is redundant from the Page Tree Section
				- Maybe add a description of *what* sso is here to serve as a project page
			- SSO Configuration Files
				- Should put the examples after the "Explained" sections
			- How to add a new client to SSO
				- May want to make it all "wide"
					- Fitting the title and "expand" in the same line makes them harder to read
				- Step 3: may want to add a "where to find" section
			- How to update a client's SSO data in the company table
				- Code block: Make the boiler plate code that has to be changed all caps
			- How to deploy SSO changes to production
				- Add a link to the how to backup article in the initial warning
			- How to import a client's SSO metadata
				- Add a link to the how to backup article in the initial warning

	- Using cards in logseq
		- Create cards with the card tag #card
		  card-last-interval:: 4
		  card-repeats:: 1
		  card-ease-factor:: 2.6
		  card-next-schedule:: 2022-11-18T21:00:32.854Z
		  card-last-reviewed:: 2022-11-14T21:00:32.854Z
		  card-last-score:: 5
			- Content of the card goes in the next line
		- You can also add tags to be able to filter by certain kinds of cards #card #logseq

		  card-last-score:: 5
			- This lets you filter the tags down so you can review just a specific topic when using the [[flashcards]] area
		- You can also add ((63727846-6f14-4843-9d9d-1f836113770e)) to cards #card #logseq/cloze

- 15:16 - Databricks training
	- Watching DE 4.1.1 - Orders Pipeline for [[databricks_data_engineering_training]]
		- Using DLT's to process data from a JSON file to a cloud saved location
		- Uses 3 stage tables
			- Bronze - Raw
			- Silver - Validates and enriches fields
			- Gold - Data aggregations for insights and dashboards
		- Delta live tables have two kinds of tables
			- Live tables
				- materialized views for lakehouse
				- updated with each refresh of the pipeline
			- Streaming live tables
				- designed for incremental and real-time data processing
			- Both are persisted as tables in the Delta Lake Protocal (ACID compliant, etc)
